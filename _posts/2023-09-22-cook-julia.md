Cooking has never been my strong suit; it is more like a daily ordeal. The mere thought of stepping into the kitchen to create a meal from scratch used to intimidate me. But everything changed when I watched the captivating movie "Julie & Julia," which ignited a fire within me to take on a thrilling challenge and embark on my culinary journey.

In the film, a talented writer, Julie Powell, takes on the audacious task of cooking through Julia Child's cookbook in a year. Her determination and passion for culinary arts inspired me to attempt something similar.
And so, my adventure began. Armed with little experience in the kitchen, I cautiously started with a few simple recipes. To my surprise, I found joy in the cooking process. Chopping, sautéing, and seasoning became delightful discoveries, and with each dish I prepared, my confidence in the kitchen soared.

I am a picky eater, and I have a lot of ingredients that I do not like in my dishes. I never followed receipt, as I usually remove the elements I don't like. Driven by Julie's innovative approach to chronicling her journey, I started a few dishes that only made for my appetite. It turns out pretty good that I can begin to share my receipt with everyone.

As I share my culinary voyage with the world, I hope my dishes stir inspiration and foster a love for cooking in seasoned food enthusiasts and curious beginners alike. Who knows? Like Julie, I might eventually craft my unique recipes, adding a personal touch to my culinary repertoire.

So, let us embrace the blissful journey of exploring diverse flavors and mastering new techniques. Here's to the joy of cooking and the endless adventures awaiting in the heart of our kitchens!
