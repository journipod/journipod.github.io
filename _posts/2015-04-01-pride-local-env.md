A year ago, I took an online course "The Search for Vernacular Architecture of Asia, Part1", I really enjoyed this class which I learned "defining vernacular architecture and Threats in Asia to traditional vernacular architecture". I've also had this pleasure to express how I feel about our local built environment and what makes me proud to classmate from the world. And I thought I could also share in public to express my opinion as well.

I live in Taipei because of job, and I am very proud of the local environment nearby 101 building in Xinyi District of Taipei. When we look for the vernacular architecture, I personally think that in Asia country sometimes is required to tear down the old buildings and build another new building for the economic growth. However, the reason I like Taipei is because the government keeps some heritage building open to public, also setting the guideline for people to get more understanding of our culture.

In our district, we have the 101 building, which is the 4th highest building the world, shopping center, super highway to connect city and urban, around that there’s an area which was military community. Now, government, replacing this place and open to public. It’s quite nice to have such beautiful place for afternoon tea in the city center.
I think a good living environment, which is very convenient, green, and strong building, also, some heritage culture building. We were living in the 20th century, the economy is growing, and we need a new building, new technology to support our environment in order to grow.
Taipei, where I live now is the best environment that I am proud of, even it’s still under development city, but the government already starts planning to keep some of the heritage buildings and replaning them in order to open public. This is very good for the citizen. We can learn the ancient heritage thru these buildings with our own eyes. And I am really like the city which combine the new and old culture, building together.
