It's the beginning of summer, and the desert heat wraps around us as we venture into the boiling Painted Canyon. Armed with our rooftop tent, we set off on an unforgettable camping escapade, promising stunning views, challenging hikes, and the serenity of the starlit desert sky. Join us as we share the story of our dispersed camping adventure in the captivating Painted Canyon.
When we arrived, it was around 104°. We hesitated to lace up our hiking boots and fill water bottles before embarking on the Ladder Canyon trail. It's our second hike in Ladder Canyon, and the entrance is not so visible for the first time. Look out for the arrow sign on the ground pointing to the entry.

One good thing about daylight saving time is that we still have plenty of time to explore the camping spot before the sun dips below the horizon. We can choose our slice of paradise amidst the rugged terrain in Painted Canyon. After some exploring, we stumbled upon a site that offered breathtaking vistas, igniting our excitement for the night ahead with a bit of fear. We were the only ones around besides a few hikers still out there.

Another essential thing is that you leave all the work, worry behind and paced yourself to enjoy the moment. Set up the rooftop tent, kitchen equipment and everything you need for the campsite. I really love the vibe and enjoyed it.
We started to set up our rooftop tent, which quickly transformed into our cozy home for the night, perched atop our vehicle. An anecdote, we traveled to Antelope Canyon two years ago and passed through the long rock beach. I saw a couple had a tent on their car; that's where I learned about rooftop tents (RTT). I am thrilled to get more information from the couples and started looking for one. This is how I got into dispersed camping.

We had a hotpot for dinner and listened to the downloaded podcast with some iced coffee. The weather still seems to be very hot; the temperature drops slowly. Preparing camping meals is far from simple; it's nothing like haphazardly tossing everything into a pot. It involves a true mastery of skills. Ensuring that the raw ingredients can be safely stored for several days is essential, as well as making sure they are easy to process and cook in the great outdoors. The ultimate goal is to create delicious dishes that can be savored and enjoyed amidst the wilderness. It's a delicate balance of practicality and culinary finesse, as campers must rely on ingenuity and resourcefulness to create satisfying meals that fuel their adventures while embracing the joys of the camping experience.

Finally, the night was coming. We crawled into our tent, and the gentle desert breeze lulled us into a peaceful slumber as we drifted off to the soothing sounds of the night, and the temperature remained high at 90°. 
Painted Canyon is a beautiful and remote area in the Mecca Hills Wilderness of Southern California. It's a great place to go dispersed camping. The temperatures in Painted Canyon can get relatively high, especially in the summer. In July, temperatures can often reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit. You must be prepared for the heat if you plan to camp in Painted Canyon during the summer.
